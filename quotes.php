<td colspan="3" class="absCenter text">The Chris Mayther Band is a powerhouse organization comprised of some of the best musicians in the Pacific Northwest. &nbsp;From the solid drumming of Rudy Battjes to the soulful and funky sound of keyboardist, Dave Fleschner -- this band's leader then provides the vocal accompaniment needed to front a band this good. &nbsp;Chris Mayther's vocals range from a heartfelt interpretation of, &quot;<a href="music.html">Rainy Night In Georgia</a>&quot; to a better-than-the-original version of Paul Delay's, &quot;Nice and Strong.&quot; &nbsp;And during their musical explorations they'll take their audience along with them on the journey. &nbsp;I highly recommend The Chris Mayther Band to blues lovers, and anyone else that wants to really hear what a Barry White tune can sound like in the hands of the right group. &nbsp;Chris Mayther Band one of the best things with a &quot;grown in Oregon&quot; label on it.<br>

&quot;Mayther's husky blues voice is marinated in vintage blues, soul and R&amp;B. &nbsp;Prowling the stage like a prize fighter, Mayther assaults every song as if it's his last. &nbsp;Succumb quietly and no one gets hurt.&quot;<br>
